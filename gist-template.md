# Regex Tutorial


## Summary
Expressions are used to generate characters combo to match a patern or string. For regular expressions or regex for short are a series of special characters that defines a search pattern like "\W" that uses forward slash \ means "match" and an uppercase W means "any non-word character". This expression is equivalent to [^A-Za-z0-9_].
While the expression "\w" again the forward slash means match but the "w" lowercase w in the case means "any word character including underscore", so \w means match any word character. This expression is equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_]. Also we notice that the upward arrow "^" represents "not".
